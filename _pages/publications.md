  This paper introduces time-varying grouped patterns of heterogeneity in linear panel data models. A distinctive feature of our approach is 
  that group membership is left unrestricted. We estimate the parameters of the model using a “grouped fixed-effects” estimator that  
  minimizes a least squares criterion with respect to all possible groupings of the cross-sectional units. Recent advances in the clustering 
  literature allow for fast and efficient computation. We provide conditions under which our estimator is consistent as both dimensions of 
  the panel tend to infinity, and we develop inference methods. Finally, we allow for grouped patterns of unobserved heterogeneity in the 
  study of the link between income and democracy across countries.
