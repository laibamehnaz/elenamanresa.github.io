<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 1.5px; font-weight: bold;">Grouped Patterns of Heterogeneity in Panel Data</p>

<details>
  <summary><span style="color: #00BFFF; text-decoration:underline; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Abstract</span></summary>
  <p style="font-size: 14px;">This paper introduces time-varying grouped patterns of heterogeneity in linear panel data models. A distinctive feature of our approach is that group membership is left unrestricted. We estimate the parameters of the model using a “grouped fixed-effects” estimator that minimizes a least squares criterion with respect to all possible groupings of the cross-sectional units. Recent advances in the clustering literature allow for fast and efficient computation. We provide conditions under which our estimator is consistent as both dimensions of the panel tend to infinity, and we develop inference methods. Finally, we allow for grouped patterns of unobserved heterogeneity in the study of the link between income and democracy across countries.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 1.5px; font-weight: bold;">An Adversarial Approach to Structural Estimation</p>


<details>
  <summary><span style="color: #00BFFF; text-decoration:underline; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Abstract</span></summary>
  <p style="font-size: 14px;">We propose a new simulation-based estimation method, adversarial estimation, for structural models. The estimator is formulated as the solution to a minimax problem between a generator (which generates simulated observations using the structural model) and a discriminator (which classifies whether an observation is simulated). The discriminator maximizes the accuracy of its
classification while the generator minimizes it. We show that, with a sufficiently
rich discriminator, the adversarial estimator attains parametric efficiency under correct specification and the parametric rate under misspecification. We advocate the use of a neural network as a discriminator that can exploit adaptivity properties and attain fast rates of convergence. We apply our method to the elderly’s saving decision model and show that our estimator uncovers the bequest motive as an important source of saving across the wealth distribution, not only for the rich.</p>

We conduct a simulation study of Local Projection (LP) and Vector Autoregression (VAR) estimators of structural impulse responses across thousands of data generating processes, designed to mimic the properties of the universe of U.S. macroeconomic data. Our analysis considers various identification schemes and several variants of LP and VAR estimators, employing bias correction, shrinkage, or model averaging. A clear bias-variance trade-off emerges: LP estimators have lower bias than VAR estimators, but they also have substantially higher variance at intermediate and long horizons. Bias-corrected LP is the preferred method if and only if the researcher overwhelmingly prioritizes bias. For researchers who also care about precision, VAR methods are the most attractive&mdash;Bayesian VARs at short and long horizons, and least-squares VARs at intermediate and long horizons.
